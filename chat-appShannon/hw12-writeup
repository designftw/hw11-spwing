	<h1>Turning in this week</h1>
	<p>This week I have a working summary feature. When you go into a channel 
        and press summary it will summarize all of the 200+ channels chats for you.
        I also did the started CSS design of profile and profile changes.This is the 
        halfway because it is the core functionality of my feature and learns to use 
        the API successfully.
    </p>


    <h1>Turning in next week</h1>
    
    <p>My final product will finish up the css and produce a summary when you 
        enter a channel of the unread messages you have in that channel. This 
        will use the API infrastructure I built but will require storing 
        and managing unread messages right before you open the channel and they become 
        read.
    </p>
