	<h1>Problem: The goal of this chat app is to summarize large groups of texts when a 
        user enters a chat app with lots of unread messages.
    </h1>
    <p>The solution is a get summary banner that displays the number of 
        unread messages so that the user can decide if they want to summarize them. With 
        one button this chat app allows a quick summary of the most recent unread texts 
        so that the user does not have to continue to scroll. Design implementation and full 
        functionality ended up being too ambitious with the unread texts, so the current implementation
        summarizes the 50 most recent messages at the moment.
