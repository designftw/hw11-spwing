		<p>Unfortunately, it took me too much time to implement the features, so I could not work too much on design. I implemented read 
			as a toggle so that the user would have more control over saying what they have and have not read, but this does compromise
			efficiency. If I had more time, if someone clicked on a thread I would mark it automatically as read and then allow for the 
			toggle unread. For uploading the pictures I would have added an uploading progress bar to show the user the system status. For replies,
			I made it a dropdown so it wouldn't clutter the user's screen, but showed all replies in one quick click for efficiency. With more time 
			I would work more on aethetics for displaying the messages and spacing so that everything is quick and easy to identify for 
			learnability and efficiency.
